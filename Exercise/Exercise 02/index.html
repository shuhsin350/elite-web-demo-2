    <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/</a>" is the current HTML standard. It obsoletes all other previously-published HTML specifications.<br><br>

        As announced at <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/05/w3c-and-whatwg-to-work-together-to-advance-the-open-web-platform/">https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/05/w3c-and-whatwg-to-work-together-to-advance-the-open-web-platform/</a>, the W3C and the WHATWG signed an agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications:
<br><br>
  <ul>        
        <li>https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/ is the single version of HTML being actively developed</li>
        <li>https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/ is the single version of the DOM specification being actively developed.</li>
    </ul>
        <br><br>
